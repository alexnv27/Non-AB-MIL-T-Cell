# Non-AB-MIL-T-Cell
The following code introduces a weekly supervised non-attention-based multiple instance learning (AB-MIL) AI model that predicts T-Cell expression from bulk transcriptomic data (abundance and spatial distribution maps). The training and validation data can be accessed publically from The Cancer Genome Atlas NSCLC (TCGA) and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium NSCLC (CPTAC), respectively. However, the testing data are redacted for privacy reasons. Features extractor foundation models UNI, CTranspath, and RetCCL are not included. Foundation model RetCCL and aggregation method top 5 mean achieved the highest accuracy.
