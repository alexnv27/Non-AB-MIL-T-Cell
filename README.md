# Non-AB-MIL-T-Cell
The following code introduces a weekly supervised non-attention-based multiple instance learning (AB-MIL) AI model that predicts T-Cell expression from bulk transcriptomic data. Model states/weights are attached to produce similar predicted abundance and spatial distribution maps. The training and validation data can be accessed publically from The Cancer Genome Atlas NSCLC (TCGA) and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium NSCLC (CPTAC), respectively. However, the testing data are redacted for privacy reasons.
